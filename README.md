  --Terminal based minesweeper game using JavaScript and node
      To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MineSweeperGame in the terminal.

        For example:
          In the terminal, navigate to the lib directory and run 'node'
          Run '.load game.js' to load contents of this file
          Then create a Game instance and run commands like so:
            let game = new Game(3, 3, 3);
            game.playMove(0, 1);
            game.playMove(1, 2);
            When done, run '.exit'
